"War, huh ? You would never know it judging by the stock market on Wednesday.U.S. equity markets were on the verge of record closes, only hours after an Iranian missile strike on a pair of U.S. Iraqi bases in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani put America on the brink of all-out war with the Islamic Republic.However, President Donald Trump said during an afternoon speech that he wasn’t expecting further retaliation from Tehran and noted that the fusillade of missiles shot at U.S. military bases resulted in no casualties.“No Americans were harmed in last night’s attack by the Iranian regime,” Trump said, during the speech in Washington, flanked by a coterie of top U.S. generals and Vice President Mike Pence.“All of our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases,” the president said.“Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,” Trump said.

"Stocks are plummeting on Thursday as trade fears wash over Wall Street again. Those losses put the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its fifth straight week in the red, a losing streak not seen since mid-2011. Five experts reveal what they’re watching. Jay Jacobs, head of research and strategy at Global X Funds, says the damage to the economy is getting harder to bounce back from. “This is a pretty aggressive escalation that’s going to be harder and harder to walk back. Yes, it does create more of an incentive to create a deal, but at the same time, we see both sides really digging their heels in. The longer this goes on the more companies have to reorient their supply chains and sales processes, so it’s going to be harder to unwind … I would say health-care stocks are pretty low exposed, a lot of domestic energy stocks that are benefiting from increased oil output are not as exposed to this. So there are more specific industries.” Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors, says this sell-off is not likely to get as bad as the drop late last year. “The threat of tariffs couldn’t get you over the finish line, and now from the U.S. perspective you’re going to see if the pain of higher tariff rates bring the Chinese back to the negotiating table. That’s going to take a while. It introduces volatility, but we don’t think it gets you back anywhere near the Dec. 24 lows because you also had the Fed on the wrong side of things back in December, you also had economic and earnings data deteriorating, and you don’t have either of those two things today.” Walter Piecyk, managing director of BTIG, says the trade war is going to hit Apple hard if it drags on. “There’s definitely very near-term impacts — meaning that a lot of things that Tim Cook talked about last quarter, which is that the sentiment towards Apple is positive as they exited the quarter, it’s clearly turned negative. He’s lucky that this is a low-volume quarter. So let’s say China is going to buy 6 million phones, if that gets cut back by 2 million, there’s $1.5 billion of revenue that’s gone and 15 cents in earnings. But if this extends into the December quarter where China is going to buy 10, 11, 12 million phones and if it worsens where China doesn’t even allow iPhones to get purchased then the impact to earnings becomes much more significant.""",0
"Despite the Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday to cut rates for the third time this year, several prominent market strategists see a big stock market selloff in the near future. Peter Cecchini of Cantor Fitzgerald expects the S&P 500 Index to be at 2,500 by early 2020, a plunge of about 18% by early next year, Business Insider reports. He sees bearish manufacturing and consumer data, making a recession likely by the second half of 2020. Albert Edwards of Societe Generale notes that stock prices have been advancing faster than earnings, and he finds this to be reminiscent of the dotcom bubble. Meanwhile, interest rate cuts by the Fed appear to be losing their potency, The Wall Street Journal reports. One reason for this loss of potency is that investment in residential housing, a major beneficiary of cuts, has declined as a share of U.S. GDP. In addition, widespread uncertainties about global growth and trade tensions are making corporations hesitant to invest, even if they can borrow at lower rates. Signifcance For Investors.""The unfolding profits recession will expose the 'growth' impostors and they will collapse, as they are on the wrong 'growth' PE valuations with the wrong EPS projections,"" Edwards said, as quoted in another BI article. ""Just like in 2001, investors will not wait to distinguish true 'growth' stocks from the impostors. Investors will slam the whole sector and work it out later,"" he added.",0
